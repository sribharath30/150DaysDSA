Hereâ€™s a **4-day plan of daily questions for mastering stacks**, covering basic operations, intermediate applications, and advanced concepts:

### **Day 1: Stack Basics**  
1. **Implement a Stack using an Array**  
   - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, Check if empty/full.  

2. **Implement a Stack using Two Queues**  
   - Perform stack operations (Push and Pop) using two queues.  

3. **Valid Parentheses**  
   - Input: `"()[]{}`"`  
   - Output: `true`  
   - Check if the input string has balanced parentheses using a stack.  

---

### **Day 2: Intermediate Problems**  
1. **Next Greater Element**  
   - Input: `[4, 5, 2, 10]`  
   - Output: `[5, 10, 10, -1]`  
   - Use a stack to find the next greater element for each element in the array.  

2. **Min Stack**  
   - Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.  

3. **Reverse a Stack**  
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   - Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`  
   - Reverse the elements in a stack using recursion.  

---

### **Day 3: Advanced Problems**  
1. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix Expression)**  
   - Input: `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]`  
   - Output: `9`  
   - Use a stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions in postfix notation.  

2. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**  
   - Input: `[2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]`  
   - Output: `10`  
   - Use a stack to calculate the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram.  

3. **Sort a Stack**  
   - Input: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`  
   - Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  
   - Sort a stack in ascending order using recursion.  

---

### **Day 4: Applications of Stacks**  
1. **Trapping Rainwater**  
   - Input: `[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]`  
   - Output: `6`  
   - Use a stack to calculate the trapped rainwater between bars.  

2. **Stock Span Problem**  
   - Input: `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`  
   - Output: `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`  
   - Use a stack to find the stock span for each day.  

3. **Find the Celebrity**  
   - A celebrity is someone who is known by everyone but knows no one.  
   - Use a stack to solve the problem in \(O(n)\) time.
