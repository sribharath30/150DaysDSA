### **Day 1: Basic Sorting Algorithms - Bubble Sort and Selection Sort**

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   - **Concept**: Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent items, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.  
   - **Time Complexity**:  
     - Best: \(O(n)\) when the list is already sorted.  
     - Average/Worst: \(O(n^2)\).  
   - **Exercise**:  
     - Implement bubble sort for an array of integers.
     - Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     - Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
   
2. **Selection Sort**  
   - **Concept**: Select the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swap it with the first unsorted element. Repeat this process for the remaining elements.  
   - **Time Complexity**:  
     - Best/Average/Worst: \(O(n^2)\).  
   - **Exercise**:  
     - Implement selection sort for an array of integers.
     - Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     - Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

### **Day 2: Insertion Sort**

1. **Insertion Sort**  
   - **Concept**: Build a sorted portion of the list one element at a time by comparing the current element with the ones before it, and inserting it into the correct position.  
   - **Time Complexity**:  
     - Best: \(O(n)\) when the list is already sorted.  
     - Average/Worst: \(O(n^2)\).  
   - **Exercise**:  
     - Implement insertion sort for an array of integers.
     - Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     - Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
   
2. **Optimizations for Insertion Sort**  
   - Discuss the optimization of Insertion Sort using binary search to find the correct position for an element.  
   - **Exercise**: Implement insertion sort using binary search for finding the insertion point.

---

### **Day 3: Merge Sort**

1. **Merge Sort**  
   - **Concept**: Use the divide-and-conquer strategy. Split the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves.  
   - **Time Complexity**:  
     - Best/Average/Worst: \(O(n \log n)\).  
     - Space Complexity: \(O(n)\) for auxiliary space.  
   - **Exercise**:  
     - Implement merge sort for an array of integers.
     - Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     - Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

2. **Merge Sort in Practice**  
   - Discuss how merge sort is often used for large datasets or external sorting (where data doesn't fit into memory).  
   - **Exercise**: Implement merge sort with a helper function for merging two sorted arrays.

---

### **Day 4: Quick Sort**

1. **Quick Sort**  
   - **Concept**: Use the divide-and-conquer strategy by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays.  
   - **Time Complexity**:  
     - Best/Average: \(O(n \log n)\).  
     - Worst: \(O(n^2)\) (happens when the pivot is poorly chosen).  
   - **Exercise**:  
     - Implement quick sort for an array of integers.
     - Input: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
     - Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

2. **Pivot Selection Strategies**  
   - Discuss different pivot selection strategies (first, last, random, and median of three) to improve the performance of quick sort.  
   - **Exercise**: Implement quick sort with a randomized pivot.

---

### **Day 5: Comparison of Sorting Algorithms**

1. **Compare Time Complexities and Real-World Use Cases**  
   - **Bubble Sort**: Inefficient for large lists, but easy to understand and implement.  
   - **Selection Sort**: Still \(O(n^2)\) but with fewer swaps than bubble sort, not stable.  
   - **Insertion Sort**: Efficient for small or nearly sorted lists, and stable.  
   - **Merge Sort**: Efficient with \(O(n \log n)\) time, stable, but requires extra space.  
   - **Quick Sort**: Efficient for large datasets with \(O(n \log n)\) time on average, but unstable and can degrade to \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Solve Common Sorting Problems**  
   - **Problem 1**: Sort an array of integers with duplicates.  
   - **Problem 2**: Sort an array of strings by length (use any sorting algorithm).  
   - **Problem 3**: Sort an array of numbers such that all even numbers come before odd numbers, maintaining their relative order.

3. **Analyze Space Complexity of Sorting Algorithms**  
   - **Bubble, Selection, Insertion**: \(O(1)\) auxiliary space.  
   - **Merge Sort**: \(O(n)\) auxiliary space.  
   - **Quick Sort**: \(O(\log n)\) space (due to recursion stack).
